Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview is Google's latest text-to-image AI model. It offers a different style and approach compared to Flux and OpenAI models and supports both text-to-image and image-to-image generation.

### How to use:
- **Text-to-Image**: Simply enter your prompt and leave the image field empty
- **Image-to-Image**: Upload an image and enter a prompt describing how you want to modify or use that image

Seed value is set for reproducibility (though actual seed support may vary by model)

### NOTE 
Please refer to this [Gemini Nano Banana guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation#image-generation-prompts) for best prompting practices. The [Black Forest Lab's Prompting Guide](https://docs.bfl.ai/guides/prompting_summary) is also applicable for this model. Experiment with different prompt styles to get the best results. When using image-to-image, be specific about what you want to do with the uploaded image.
