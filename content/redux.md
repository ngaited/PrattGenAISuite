Flux Redux re-styles an image based on a text prompt while preserving core content and composition. Use it for aesthetic changes such as art style, color grading, lighting, or mood.

### Seed
Use the Seed field for reproducibility. The same prompt, seed, and settings should yield consistent results.

### Guidance
Controls prompt adherence vs. naturalism.
- Higher guidance: stronger style match, may reduce realism/diversity.
- Lower guidance: subtler, more natural changes.
- Start around 2.0–3.0 and adjust as needed.

### How to use
- Upload an image.
- Describe the target style/mood (e.g., “cinematic teal–orange, dusk lighting, shallow depth of field”).
- Set seed and guidance, then generate.

### Tips
- Be specific about style cues (art movement, medium, palette, lighting, camera/lens).
- Mention what to preserve (“keep subject identity and composition”).
- Use negatives to avoid unwanted shifts (“no heavy film grain”).
- If results look overbaked, lower guidance or simplify the prompt.
