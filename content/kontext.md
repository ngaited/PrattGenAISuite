Flux Kontext Pro applies natural‑language edits to an existing image while preserving its overall composition. Use it to add, remove, or modify elements; adjust style, color, or lighting; or make global tweaks.

Seed
Use the Seed field for reproducibility. Running the same prompt with the same seed and parameters should yield consistent results.

### How to use
- Upload an image.
- Describe the change you want (what, where, how), then generate.
- Iterate by refining the prompt or trying a new seed.

### Tips
- Be specific: target objects and attributes (“Add a small red hat to the person on the right”).
- Provide context for consistent blending (style, lighting, perspective).
- Use negatives to avoid unwanted changes (“Do not alter the background buildings”).
- Make one or two focused edits per run for more predictable results.

### Examples
- “Add a red hat to the person.”
- “Change the background to a beach scene at sunset.”
- “Make the sky more dramatic with storm clouds.”
- “Add wildflowers to the foreground.”
- “Change the car color to metallic blue.”
